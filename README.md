## Running

Solutions in Python or Typescript are executable and contain a shebang line so you can run them under POSIX Compliant environmets by just invoking the filename:

e.g. 

```shell script
./day3.py
```

Python solution require Python 3 - `python3` executable in User's `$PATH`.

TypeScript solution require `Deno` runtime - https://deno.land

Solutions in Go require the Go toolchain (https://golang.org/doc/install) and can be executed with the `run` subcommand e.g.

```shell script
go run ./day6.go
```
